#write a program that prompts for a file name, then opens that file and reads through the file, looking for lines of the form:
#X-DSPAM-Confidence:    0.8475
#Count these lines and extract the floating point values from each of the lines and compute the average of those values 
#and produce an output as shown below. Do not use the sum() function or a variable named sum in your solution.

fhand=input("Enter a filename:")
fh=open(fhand)
count=0
total=0
for line in fh:
    if line.startswith("X-DSPAM-Confidence:"):
        count=count+1
        x=float(line[line.find("0"):])
        total=x+total
print("Average spam confidence:", total/count)

#Below is the assignment using sum()
